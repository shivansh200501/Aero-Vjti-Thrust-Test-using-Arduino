#ARDUINO REPO

This is the repo of all my arduino codes that I develop for my team. My team "AERO VJTI" participated in the AIAA Design Build Fly Competition which was held in Arizona.
My job was to choose the perfect the propulsion system (a combination motor, propellor , battery and esc) in which i had to analyze various dataset values of specific motor using various softwares like "MotoCalc".         
Being the "Propulsion and Data Analysis" Sector Head i introduced a new meathod to measure thrust values practically with the help of Arduino board
